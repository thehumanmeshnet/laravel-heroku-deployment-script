# laravel-heroku-deployment-script
Ive written this script to be able to easily deploy my laravel application to the heroku cloud platform. The app cleans up nicely and deletes itself after completion.


* Usage

        $ git clone https://github.com/thehumanmeshnet/laravel-heroku-deployment-script.git
		$ sh laravel-heroku-deployment-script/herokusetupscript.sh
